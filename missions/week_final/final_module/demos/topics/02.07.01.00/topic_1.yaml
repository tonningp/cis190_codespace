  1.  In the final directory that you just created, you will need to 
      copy 2 compressed tar files found in the directory 
      `/workspaces/codespaces-blank/cis190_codespace/resources`
      to the `final` directory in the your home directory that you created in the
      last task.


      > :note: Note you will need to make sure that you are in the
      > `final` directory before you copy the files which means you will need to be
      > in your home directory first. Remember how to print your current working 
      > directory?


  1. the first file to copy is named ***final_configs.tgz***

  1. the second file to copy is named ***final_logs.tgz***

  1. Use the `tar` command to **decompress and untar** both files in the `final` directory.
