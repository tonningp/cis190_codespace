  ## 🛩️ Changing config settings
  1.  Create a directory and subdirectory called data/aircraft in the `final`
      directory that you created in a previous task.

      > :note: Note you will need to make sure that you are in the
      > `final` directory before you create the directories which means you will need to be
      > in your home directory first. Remember how to print your current working 
      > directory?


  1. Move the configs and logs files that you untarred in the previous task
     to the `data/aircraft` directory.

  1. Update the `max_altitude` setting for all files with the tail number `n123ab`
      to `30000` in the respective INI file in the `data/aircraft/configs` directory.

   > :note: You can use vi to edit the INI files, or you can use a text editor
   > of your choice.
