# Welcome to Linux

Operating systems (OS) are the foundational software that manage computer hardware and software resources. They consist of:

- **Kernel**: Allocates machine resources and schedules tasks.
- **System Programs**: Include device drivers, libraries, shells, and more.

For Linux, many components were developed by the GNU Project. The Linux kernel originated from Linus Torvalds, with its first release in 1991, and has since evolved through global collaboration.
