## üñ•Ô∏è Introduction to the Operating System and the Shell

### What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is the essential software layer that manages a computer‚Äôs hardware and provides a platform for other software to run. It handles vital tasks such as:

* Managing CPU, memory, and storage devices
* Running and scheduling programs
* Enabling communication between software and hardware
* Providing user interfaces and security controls

In the context of drone maintenance, the **Linux-based OS** serves as the operational backbone for both flying and ground-based data centers. These systems rely on the **Linux kernel** ‚Äî which controls low-level hardware interactions ‚Äî and a suite of **GNU utilities** that perform file management, process control, and system configuration. Together, they coordinate the flow of telemetry, diagnostics, and mission-critical data between airborne sensors and ground stations. This infrastructure ensures secure, efficient, and deterministic behavior that is essential for mission readiness and operational continuity.
