# Exercise: Passwords and Security

Linux enforces password rules to protect accounts.

## Examples of Weak Passwords:
- `1234` (too short)
- `password` (too common)
- `abc123` (predictable)

**Exercise:** Try changing your password.  When the terminal is ready, enter the following command:

```bash
passwd
```
Note: 
Enter the passwd command and follow the prompts to change your password.  
This is a simulation, it will ask you for your old password, the old password
is `linux123`.  The new password must be at least 8 characters long and contain 
a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.  Remember to use a strong password that 
is not easily guessable.  This is not a real password change, but it simulates 
the process.
