# sudo and su Best Practice

* Use `sudo` for individual commands â€” it's safer and auditable
* Avoid `su` unless you're doing sustained admin work and know what you're doing

## ðŸ§ª Try It Yourself

* View the current user: `whoami`
* Use `sudo whoami` and observe the difference
* Switch with `su` and try `whoami` again
