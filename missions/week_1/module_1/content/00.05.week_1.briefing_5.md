# üõ∞Ô∏è Week 1 - Module 1 - The Training Shell

## Exercise: The Training Shell
The training shell is a simulated environment designed to help you practice and
learn shell commands without affecting any real world systems. It provides a space
to safely:
* Experiment with commands
* Understand how the shell interprets input
* Learn the syntax and structure of shell commands
* Practice scripting and automation tasks

### How to use the Training Shell

If a slide has an exercise, it will be indicated with the word **Exercise**.

This slide is an exercise, so you should see the word **Exercise** near the top of
the slide.

Press `n` to continue to the training shell. When you see the prompt `$` type:

**`pwd`** press Enter then type **`exit`** press Enter.

When you leave the traning shell, you will go to the next slide.
