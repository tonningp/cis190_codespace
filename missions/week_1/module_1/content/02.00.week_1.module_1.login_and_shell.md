# Remotely Logging In With SSH

Since we are using a system that is not managed by us, we will simulate the login process.  Codespaces doesn't require a login, but we will simulate the experience.

When you open a terminal in Codespaces, you are already logged in. However, 
if you were to connect to a remote system via SSH, you would typically start the session with a command like this:

```
$ ssh user@hostname
```
You would replace `user` with your username and `hostname` with the address of the system you are connecting to.

When you connect to a remote system, you may be prompted for your password.  The prompt will look like this:

```
user@hostname's password:
```
