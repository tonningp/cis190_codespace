title: Summary Check – Module 1 – Login, Shell, and Navigation
description: |
  This rubric evaluates student mastery of Linux login procedures,
  shell environments, and basic navigation commands within the context
  of drone technician readiness. The associated logs demonstrate
  practical understanding of authentication, session management, and
  command-line environment familiarity.
criteria:
  - id: login_and_shell
    description: Simulate a Linux console login with training credentials.
    learning_outcome: |
      Student demonstrates understanding of console authentication mechanisms
      and the importance of secure access protocols in unmanned system maintenance environments.
    required_log: 02.01.week_1.module_1.login_and_shell.grade.log
    expected_commands:
      - "controller login:"
      - "Username: student"
      - "password: linux123"
    points: 2
    notes: |
      The login simulation builds foundational understanding of user-based security controls
      relevant to restricted maintenance terminals for drone systems.

  - id: shell_prompt_check
    description: Access the shell and observe the shell environment.
    learning_outcome: |
      Student can identify their active shell session and recognize
      key shell environment variables used in drone diagnostic scripts and system checks.
    required_log: 02.02.week_1.module_1.shell_prompt_check.grade.log
    expected_commands:
      - "whoami"
      - "echo $SHELL"
    points: 2
    notes: |
      Ensures awareness of system identity and shell interpreter — critical
      when using maintenance scripts and configuration tools.

  - id: shell_navigation
    description: Demonstrate command-line navigation skills.
    learning_outcome: |
      Student can reliably navigate the Linux file system using relative and absolute paths.
      This is essential for accessing and maintaining drone firmware, configuration files, and logs.
    required_log: 02.03.week_1.module_1.shell_navigation.grade.log
    expected_commands:
      - "pwd"
      - "ls"
      - "cd /"
      - "cd ~"
    points: 3
    notes: |
      Demonstrates ability to orient within the file system,
      enabling structured access to drone-related system directories.

  - id: shell_history_and_exit
    description: Understand how to manage command history and exit sessions properly.
    learning_outcome: |
      Student understands shell session lifecycle, can review past commands,
      and can cleanly terminate sessions — an important aspect of maintaining
      secure and auditable technician workstations.
    required_log: 02.04.week_1.module_1.shell_history_and_exit.grade.log
    expected_commands:
      - "history"
      - "exit"
    points: 3
    notes: |
      Validates familiarity with session tracking and proper logout hygiene, particularly
      important on shared maintenance terminals or portable diagnostics systems.
