# Virtual Machines (VMs) and Their Advantages

Virtual machines offer several benefits over physical machines:

- **Isolation**: Each VM is independent, enhancing security.
- **Power Efficiency**: Consolidates multiple servers onto fewer machines.
- **Development**: Supports multiple environments for testing.

VMs enable flexible and efficient resource utilization, making them ideal for diverse computing needs.
