# Help options

## Accessing Help and Documentation from the application

## `--help` Option

Most commands also accept a `--help` flag:

```bash
tar --help | less
```

The command above is a series of commands piped together. The `tar --help` command displays the help documentation for the `tar` command, and the `| less` part allows you to scroll through the output using the `less` command.


Try this in the terminal, to see the help documentation for the `tar` command. You can use `less` to scroll through the output.
To exit `less`, press `q`.
