# Passwords and Security

Linux enforces password rules to protect accounts.

## Examples of Weak Passwords:
- `1234` (too short)
- `password` (too common)
- `abc123` (predictable)

Try changing your password, in the teminal type:
```bash
passwd
```

Note: After pressing enter, you will be put into a test shell.
Enter the passwd command and follow the prompts to change your password.  This is a simulation, it will ask you for your old password, but you can enter any value.  The new password must be at least 8 characters long and contain a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.  Remember to use a strong password that is not easily guessable.  This is not a real password change, but it simulates the process.
