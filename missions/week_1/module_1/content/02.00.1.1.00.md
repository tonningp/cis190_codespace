# Welcome to Linux

Operating systems (OS) are the foundational software that manage computer hardware and software resources. They consist of:

- The **Kernel**: The kernel allocates machine resources and schedules tasks.
- **System Programs**: Includes device drivers, libraries, shells, and more.

For Linux, many components were developed by the GNU Project. The Linux kernel originated from Linus Torvalds (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), with its first release in 1991, and has since evolved through global collaboration.

You can find the source code for the Linux kernel at
