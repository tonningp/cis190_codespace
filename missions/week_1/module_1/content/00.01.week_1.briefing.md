# üõ∞Ô∏è Week 1 - Module 1 - System Overview

## Tutorial Briefing

## Overview
  - **Objective**: Understand the Linux system architecture and components.
  - **Estimated Duration**: 5 minutes.

  - **Review Tasks** 
      - This tutorial system is designed to help you understand the basic components of a Linux system.
      - Each "slide" (what you are reading now) will provide an overview of a topic.
      - There may be exercises or tasks to complete after the slide, it will indicate that with a title of **Exercise**.
      - As an example, at the bottom of this slide it should say
      **Press ENTER to continue...**
      - If you press Enter, you may go to a new slide or you may be put into a training shell
      - Go ahead and press Enter to continue.


## üñ•Ô∏è Introduction to the Operating System and the Shell

### What is an Operating System?

An **Operating System (OS)** is the essential software layer that manages a computer‚Äôs hardware and provides a platform for other software to run. It handles vital tasks such as:

* Managing CPU, memory, and storage devices
* Running and scheduling programs
* Enabling communication between software and hardware
* Providing user interfaces and security controls

In the context of drone maintenance, the **Linux-based OS** serves as the operational backbone for both flying and ground-based data centers. These systems rely on the **Linux kernel** ‚Äî which controls low-level hardware interactions ‚Äî and a suite of **GNU utilities** that perform file management, process control, and system configuration. Together, they coordinate the flow of telemetry, diagnostics, and mission-critical data between airborne sensors and ground stations. This infrastructure ensures secure, efficient, and deterministic behavior that is essential for mission readiness and operational continuity.

### What is the Shell?

The **shell** is a user interface provided by the OS that allows users to interact with the system by typing commands.

It serves as:

* A **command interpreter**, translating human-readable input into instructions the OS can execute
* A **scripting environment**, where technicians can automate tasks like log collection, firmware updates, and system diagnostics
* A **tool for precision and control**, especially in environments where graphical interfaces are unavailable (e.g., remote drone access terminals)

Popular shell types in Linux include **bash** (Bourne Again Shell), **sh**, and **tcsh**, each offering different features and scripting syntax. Drone technicians use the shell to troubleshoot, configure systems, and review logs ‚Äî skills that are critical in real-world drone support operations.
