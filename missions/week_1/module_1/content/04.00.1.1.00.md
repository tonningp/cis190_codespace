# Free Software and the GNU Philosophy

Free software emphasizes freedom, not price. It allows users to:

- Study, redistribute, and modify the source code.
- Collaborate and share enhancements.

Stallman's GNU Manifesto champions these freedoms, advocating for a cooperative software ecosystem that respects user rights and fosters innovation.
