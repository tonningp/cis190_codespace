# üõ∞Ô∏è Week 1 - Module 1 - Computing Systems and IPOS

## üñ•Ô∏è Introduction to Computing Systems
This module introduces the concept of computing systems, their components, and 
the fundamental functions they perform. Understanding these concepts is
essential for grasping how operating systems manage resources and provide users
with a platform to run applications and processes.
## What is a Computing System?
A **computing system** is a combination of hardware and software designed to
perform tasks, process data, and provide services. It consists of:

* **Hardware**: Physical components like CPUs, memory, storage, and input/output
  devices
* **Software**: Programs and operating systems that instruct the hardware on
  how to perform tasks
* **Users**: Individuals or systems that interact with the computing system to
  achieve specific goals

## Computing System Functions IPOS
A computing system performs several key functions:
* **Input**: Accepting data from users or other systems
* **Processing**: Manipulating data according to predefined instructions
* **Output**: Delivering processed data to users or other systems
* **Storage**: Saving data for future use, either temporarily or permanently
