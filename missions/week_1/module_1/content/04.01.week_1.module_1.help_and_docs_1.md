# Help options

## Accessing Help and Documentation from the application

## `--help` Option

Many linux commands also accept a `--help` flag:

```bash
tar --help | less
```

The command above is really 2 commands with what is called a pipe. The `tar --help` command displays the help documentation for the `tar` command, and the `| less` part allows you to scroll through the output using the `less` command.

***The `|` key character:***

* Located **just above Enter**, on the **right edge** of the third row of the
  keyboard.
* Press **Shift + \\** to type the `|` (pipe) character.

## Exercise: Try it Yourself
Try this in the terminal. To see the help documentation for the `tar` command, type the command in the training shell. You can use the up and down
arrow keys to scroll through the output.

```bash
    tar --help | less
```

To exit `less`, press `q`.
