# üõ∞Ô∏è Week 1 - Module 1 - Command Line Interface (CLI)
### What is the Shell?

The **shell** is a user interface sometime called `CLI`, provided by the OS that allows users to interact with the system by typing commands.

It serves as:

* A **command interpreter**, translating human-readable input into instructions the OS can execute
* A **scripting environment**, where technicians can automate tasks like log collection, firmware updates, and system diagnostics
* A **tool for precision and control**, especially in environments where graphical interfaces are unavailable (e.g., remote access terminals)

Popular shell types in Linux include **bash** (Bourne Again Shell), **zsh**, and **tcsh**, each offering different features and scripting syntax. 
Technicians use the shell to troubleshoot, configure systems, and review logs ‚Äî skills that are critical in real-world support operations.
For this course, we will focus on the **bash shell**, which is widely used in Linux environments and provides a robust set of features for both interactive use and scripting.
