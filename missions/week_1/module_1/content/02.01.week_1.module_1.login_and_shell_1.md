## Exercise
## Console or Terminal Login

If you login to a console or terminal on a Linux system, you will see a prompt like this:

```
hostname login:
```
The `hostname` is the name of the computer you are logging into.
You would enter your username, and then you would be prompted for your password:

**Please note:**
Linux does not reveal whether your username or password is incorrect.  If
you enter an incorrect username or password, you may see a message like this:

`Login incorrect`

This protects against account guessing attacks.

For this exercise, we will simulate a login. When in the training shell, use the following username and password:

Username: `student`
password: `linux123`
