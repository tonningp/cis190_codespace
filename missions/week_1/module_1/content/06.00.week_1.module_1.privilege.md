# Privilege Escalation in Linux: `sudo` vs `su`

## Understanding `sudo` and `su`

In Linux, both `sudo` and `su` are used to perform tasks as another user — typically the **superuser (root)**.

## 🔐 `sudo` – Run a Command as Another User

- Stands for: **"substitute user do"**
- Executes a **single command** as another user (default: root)
- Requires your **own password**, not root's
- Safer for everyday use

***Example:***
```bash
sudo apt update
````

🔒 Users must be in the `sudoers` file.
