# Using Root Privileges with su/sudo

**Gaining Root Privileges**:

- Use `su` to execute commands with root privileges:
  ```bash
  $ su -c 'ls -l /lost+found'
  ```

- Use `sudo` to execute commands with your password:
  ```bash
  $ sudo ls -l /lost+found
  ```

> **Caution**: Do not experiment while working with root privileges to avoid system damage.
