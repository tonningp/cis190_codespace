# Introduction to Getting Started with Linux

Whether you are using a graphical user interface (GUI) or a textual interface, this lesson focuses on the command-line interface (CLI). If you're working with a GUI, you'll need a terminal emulator such as `xterm`, `Konsole`, or `GNOME Terminal`.  If you are running this lesson on a server such as codespaces, you will likely be using a terminal directly.

> **Note**: Be cautious when working with root privileges to avoid damaging the system.
