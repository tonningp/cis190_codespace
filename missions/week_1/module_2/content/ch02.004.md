**Advantages of the Textual Interface**:

- More powerful and flexible than graphical counterparts, e.g., `chmod`.
- Scripts can automate tasks across multiple systems.
- Essential for server systems without GUIs to save resources.

**Pseudographical Interfaces**: Bridge between textual and graphical interfaces, e.g., `mc` (Midnight Commander).

> **Tip**: Ensure the `TERM` variable is set correctly to avoid display issues.
