# Correcting Mistakes and Repeating Commands

**Correcting Mistakes**:

- Use the BACKSPACE key to erase characters.
- Use `stty ek` to set default erase and line kill keys.

**Repeating Commands**:

- Use the UP and DOWN ARROW keys to browse command history.
- Use `!!` to repeat the last command or `^old^new^` to replace strings in the previous command.

> **Caution**: Use the KILL signal as a last resort to abort programs. It can corrupt data.
