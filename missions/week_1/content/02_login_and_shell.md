# Logging In and Using the Shell

If you first connect to a Linux system, you'll see a prompt for your username and password.

Linux does not reveal whether your username or password is incorrect:
> `Login incorrect`

This protects against account guessing attacks.

Use the following username and password

Username: student
password: linux123
