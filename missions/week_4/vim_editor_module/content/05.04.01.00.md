# Inserting and Correcting Text in vim

To insert text:

- Enter Input mode with `i` (insert) or `a` (append).
- Correct mistakes using backspace or word-kill keys.
- Return to Command mode with `ESCAPE`.

Example text entry:

```
i
This is a sample paragraph.
```

> vim wraps text, but for structured drone logs, press `RETURN` before reaching line ends.
