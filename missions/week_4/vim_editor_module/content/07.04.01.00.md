# Advanced Text Correction and Navigation

To replace or correct text:

- Use `x` to delete a character.
- `u` undoes the last change; `CONTROL-R` redoes it.
- Navigate with `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, or arrow keys.

For efficient editing, familiarize with:

- `w`/`b` for word navigation.
- `0`/`$` for line start/end.

> Efficient navigation aids in quick log reviews and updates.
