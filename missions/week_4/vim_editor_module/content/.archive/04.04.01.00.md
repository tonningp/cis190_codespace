# vim Modes: Command and Input

vim operates in different modes:

- **Command Mode**: Enter commands (e.g., delete text).
- **Input Mode**: Enter text directly.
- **Last Line Mode**: Enter commands prefixed with `:` (e.g., `:set number`).

Switch modes with `ESCAPE` to return to Command mode.

> **Tip**: Use `:set number` for line numbers to enhance navigation.
