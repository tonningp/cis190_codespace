# Graded Activity: Redirection Mastery

Complete the following tasks:
- Redirect `ls` output to `listing.txt`
- Append a `date` command to the same file
- Pipe `cat listing.txt` to `wc -l`
- Run a `sleep 5` command in the background and check it with `jobs`

Record the session using `script` and submit your `.typescript` file.
