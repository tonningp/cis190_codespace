# Setting Up an OpenSSH Server (`sshd`)

#### Prerequisites

- Install the `openssh-server` package.

#### Configuration

Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` for custom settings. Key settings include:

- **PermitRootLogin**: Set to `no` for security.
- **PasswordAuthentication**: Set to `no` to enforce key-based authentication.

Start `sshd` service and ensure it is listening on the designated port (default is 22).
