# Advanced `rsync` Options

- `--compress`, `-z`: Compress files during transfer.
- `--update`, `-u`: Skip files that are newer in the destination.
- `--link-dest=dir`: Create hard links for identical files in backups, reducing storage space.

#### Example: Using `--link-dest`
```bash
rsync --archive --link-dest=../backup source/ destination
```

This command efficiently manages backups by linking unchanged files to the previous backup.

> **Note:** `--link-dest=dir` is useful for making incremental backups appear as full backups.
