# Managing Processes

- **Jobs**: Use `jobs` to list background jobs.
- **Foreground and Background**: Use `fg` and `bg` to move jobs between the foreground and background.
- **Suspending Jobs**: Use `CONTROL-Z` to suspend a job.
  
> **Note**: Understanding job control is essential for managing concurrent processes efficiently.
