title: Exercise – Identifying Built-In Commands

content: |
  Use `type` to find out how Bash treats a command.

  ## :try: Try it

  ```bash
  type cd
  type ls
  type echo
  ````
  * `cd` is built-in
  * `ls` is external (usually `/bin/ls`)

  ✅ Use `type` to distinguish between shell features and binaries.
