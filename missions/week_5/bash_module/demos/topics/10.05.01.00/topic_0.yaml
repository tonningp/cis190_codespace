title: Exercise – Using a for Loop to Process Logs

content: |
  Use a `for` loop to iterate over flight log files.

  ## :try:  Try it

  ```bash
  for log in ~/drone_toolkit/flight_logs/*.log; do
    echo "Processing: $log"
    wc -l "$log"
  done
  ````

  This counts the number of lines in each log file.

  ✅ `for` loops are useful for batch operations in automation scripts.
