title: Exercise – While and Until Loops

content: |
  Try both `while` and `until` loops in an interactive shell.
  ## :try: Try it
  ```bash
  count=1
  while [ $count -le 3 ]; do
    echo "System check $count"
    ((count++))
  done
  ````
  Then test:
  ```bash
  x=5
  until [ "$x" -eq 0 ]; do
    echo "$x seconds remaining"
    ((x--))
  done
  ```

  ✅ Loops help monitor and retry operations until successful.
