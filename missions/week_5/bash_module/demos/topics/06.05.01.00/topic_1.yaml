title: Exercise â€“ Input Redirection from File

content: |
  Use input redirection (`<`) to supply data to a command.
  ## :try: Try It
  1. Create a test file:
     ```bash
     echo "UAV, Ground Station, Ready" > config_input.txt
     ```
  2. Pass it to `cat` using `<`:
     ```bash
     cat < config_input.txt
     ```
  3. Try with other tools like `wc`:
     ```bash
     wc -w < config_input.txt
     ```
  ## :note:
  `< file` replaces keyboard input.
