content: |
  Add a conditional check to your `startup_check.sh` script.

  ## :filetree: Edit your `startup_check.sh` file and add the following
  ```bash
  if [ -f drone_config.txt ]; then
    echo "Drone config file found."
  else
    echo "No config found. Please upload it."
  fi
  ```
  Save it and run the script:
  ```bash
  ./startup_check.sh
  ```
  ✅ This is your first conditional logic in a Bash script.
