title: Exercise – Using && for Success Chains

content: |
  Chain commands so the second one only runs if the first succeeds.
  ## :try: Try it
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/drone_toolkit/test && echo "Test folder created"
  ```
  Now try:
  ```bash
  mkdir ~/drone_toolkit/test && echo "Second attempt"
  ```
  Only the first `echo` should run — the second `mkdir` fails.

  ✅ `&&` helps avoid running follow-up commands unnecessarily.
