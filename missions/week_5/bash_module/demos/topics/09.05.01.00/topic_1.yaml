title: Exercise – Using || for Failover Commands

content: |
  Use `||` to run a command **only if** the first one fails.
  ## :try: Try it
  ```bash
  ls missing_file.txt || echo "File not found – skipping analysis"
  ```
  Try again with a real file:
  ```bash
  touch found.log
  ls found.log || echo "Missing"
  ```
  ✅ `||` is helpful for fallback messages and error handling.
