# Locating Utilities

Find and manage utilities on your system:

- **which**: Displays the path of executables
- **whereis**: Locates binary, source, and manual page files
- **locate**: Searches for files by name

```bash
# Locate a command
which ls

# Find all references to a utility
whereis tar
```

> **Caution**: `which` and `whereis` do not report shell builtins.
