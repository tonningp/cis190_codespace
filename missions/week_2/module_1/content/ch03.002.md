# Special Characters in the Shell

Special characters have specific meanings in the shell. It's crucial to avoid using them in filenames until you understand their implications:

- Special Characters: `& ; | * ? ' " [ ] ( ) $ < > { } # / \ ! ~`
- **Whitespace**: RETURN, SPACE, and TAB have special meanings.
- **Quoting Special Characters**:
  - **Backslash**: Precede with `\` to escape.
  - **Single Quotes**: Enclose in `' '` to treat as regular characters.
  
> **Note**: A slash `/` remains a separator in pathnames, even when quoted.
