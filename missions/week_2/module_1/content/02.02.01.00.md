# Special Characters in the Shell

Special characters have specific meanings in the shell. It's crucial to avoid using them in filenames until you understand their implications:

- Special Characters: `& ; | * ? ' " [ ] ( ) $ < > { } # / \ ! ~`
- **Whitespace**: RETURN, SPACE, and TAB have special meanings.
- **Quoting Special Characters**:
  - **Backslash**: Precede special characters with `\` to escape.  **Note:** some exercises may require escaping the backslash itself. `\\`, therefore if you needed two backslashes it would look like `\\\\`, this from the C language, but all computer languages including the shell are like this.
  - **Single Quotes**: Enclose in `' '` to treat as regular characters.  If you
    needed to quote a single quote, you would use `'\''` (a single quote,
    followed by an escaped single quote, followed by another single quote).
    If there is an exercise that asks for this your would need to quote the
    backspace too, so it would look like `'\\''`.  What this means is that one
    should not use single quotes, slashes or space in filenames.
  
> **Note**: A forward slash `/` remains a separator in file and pathnames, even when quoted. You would never have a `/` in a file or directory name, but you might have a `\` in a file or directory name, and you would need to escape it with another `\` if you wanted to use it in a command.
