export lesson_title="Previewing Files with \`head\` and \`tail\`"
export lesson="$(cat<<EOF

**Practice using the \`head\` and \`tail\` commands to preview file content.**

This lesson focuses on:
1. Viewing the first few lines of a file with \`head\`
2. Viewing the last few lines of a file with \`tail\`
3. Using the \`-n\` option to specify the number of lines to show

> ðŸ“„ These commands are helpful when inspecting logs or verifying file structure without opening large files entirely.
