# Filename Conventions in Linux (3 of 4)

## 5. Utilize Leading Zeros for Numerical Sorting

**Purpose:** When dealing with files that include numbers, use leading zeros to ensure the files are sorted in natural numerical order.

**Example:**
- Rename `file1.txt` and `file10.txt` to `file01.txt` and `file10.txt`, respectively.

## 6. Limit the Use of Extensions Appropriately

**Purpose:** While extensions are less critical in Linux (since file type is often determined by content), using appropriate file extensions can still be useful for quickly identifying file types and ensuring compatibility with certain applications.

**Example:**
- For text files, use `.txt`. For scripts, use `.sh`.
