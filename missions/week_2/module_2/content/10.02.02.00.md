# Links in Linux

Links are pointers to files:

- **Hard Links**: Direct pointers to file data, cannot span filesystems.
- **Symbolic Links**: Pointers to file paths, can span filesystems.

Create links using:

- Hard Link: `ln original_file link_name`
- Symbolic Link: `ln -s original_file link_name`
