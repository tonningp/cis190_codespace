# Hierarchical Filesystem Explained

The Linux filesystem is often compared to a tree structure:

- **Root Directory (`/`)**: The top of the hierarchy.
- **Subdirectories**: Dedicate each to a unique subject, such as projects or events.
- **Ordinary Files**: Data files stored at the ends of paths.
- **Directory Files**: Points for branching paths.

This structure allows expansion and efficient file organization.
