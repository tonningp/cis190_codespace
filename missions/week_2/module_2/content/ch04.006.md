# Working with Pathnames

Pathnames navigate the filesystem:

- **Absolute Pathnames**: Start with `/`, allowing access from any directory.
- **Relative Pathnames**: Start from the working directory.

Use `pwd` to display the current directory and `cd` to navigate.

Example of an absolute path: `/home/user/docs`
