# Filename Conventions in Linux (2 of 4)

## 3. Use Lowercase and Consistent Separators

**Purpose:** Consistency and readability are key. By using lowercase letters and consistent separators, such as underscores or hyphens, you ensure that your filenames are easy to read and less error-prone.

**Example:**
- Rename `My File.docx` to `my_file.docx`.

## 4. Keep Filenames Short but Descriptive

**Purpose:** While descriptiveness is important, filenames that are too long can be cumbersome. It's essential to strike a balance between descriptiveness and brevity.

**Example:**
- Instead of `20231019_project_final_version_completed_notes.txt`, opt for `project_notes.txt`.
