# File and Directory Permissions

Access permissions control who can access files and how:

- **Owner, Group, Others**: Three categories of users.
- **Permissions**: Read, write, and execute.

Use `ls -l` to display permissions and `chmod` to modify:

```bash
chmod a+rw file.txt  # Add read/write for all users
```
