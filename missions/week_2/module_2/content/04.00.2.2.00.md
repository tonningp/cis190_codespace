# Directory Files and Ordinary Files

In a filesystem tree:

- **Ordinary Files**: Cannot support other paths; contain data or programs.
- **Directory Files**: Also known as folders, can contain other directories or files.

Each path ends in an ordinary or directory file. Use tree structures for efficient file management.
