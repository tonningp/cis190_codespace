# Overview of the Linux Filesystem

A filesystem is a set of data structures on a disk to hold directories and files. It organizes user and system data, which is essential for system operations and user tasks. Key topics include:

- Hierarchical structure: Organizes files for easy access.
- Directory and ordinary files: Differentiates types of files.
- Absolute and relative pathnames: Methods to navigate the filesystem.

Refer to utilities like `df`, `fsck`, `mkfs`, and `tune2fs` for more on filesystems.
