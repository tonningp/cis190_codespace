## Special Characters

Special characters have unique meanings to the shell:

- Avoid using these characters in filenames: `& ; | * ? ' " â€˜ [ ] ( ) $ < > { } # / \ ! ~`.
- Whitespace characters like RETURN, SPACE, and TAB have special shell meanings.
- Quoting special characters prevents the shell from interpreting them.

# Quoting Methods

- **Backslash**: Precede a character with a backslash `\` to quote it.
- **Single Quotation Marks**: Enclose characters in single quotes `'`.
