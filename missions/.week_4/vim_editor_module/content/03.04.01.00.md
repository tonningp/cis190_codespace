# Starting vim and Basic Navigation

To start vim and create/edit a file named 'practice':

```bash
vim practice
```

Initial screen indicators:
- Tildes (~) show an empty file.
- Status line displays file creation/editing info.

For terminal issues, reset with:

```bash
:q!
```

> Ensure the terminal type is correctly set to avoid display distortions.
