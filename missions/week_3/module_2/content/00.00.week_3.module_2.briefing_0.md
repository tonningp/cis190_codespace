# Week 3 Module 2 Briefing

## Mission: Permissions, Ownership, and Access Control

To prevent unauthorized changes to drone profiles or log files, permissions and ownership must be correctly set. Your **supervisor** needs you to verify and modify access controls on several critical files.

### Objectives:
- Display file permissions and ownership
- Change permissions with `chmod`
- Modify ownership with `chown`
- Explore ACLs for finer-grained control
