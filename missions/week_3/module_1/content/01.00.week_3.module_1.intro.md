# Introduction to the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy

Understanding the Linux filesystem hierarchy is crucial for organizing drone data, logs, and software components. You'll use `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, and `tree` to explore and describe filesystem layout.

## Tools Preview
- `pwd`: Print current (working) directory
- `cd`: Change directories
- `ls`: List files and directories
- `tree`: Visualize directory trees
