## Pipelines and Filters

# Pipelines

- Combine commands using `|`.
- Example: `command_a | command_b`.

### Filters

- Process input and produce output.
- Use pipelines to connect commands.

### Examples

- `tr` and `lpr` can be used in pipelines.
- `sort` processes input streams for ordered output.
