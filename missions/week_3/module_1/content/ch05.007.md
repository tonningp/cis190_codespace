## Working with Paths and Executables

# Absolute vs. Relative Pathnames

- **Absolute**: Begins with `/`.
- **Relative**: Includes `/` but doesn't start with `/`.
- **Simple Filenames**: No `/`.

### Finding Executables

- The shell searches directories in `PATH` for executables.
- Use `which` or `whereis` to locate executables.
