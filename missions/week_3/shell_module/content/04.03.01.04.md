# 🐚 Introduction to Shell Basics (Wildcards)

Welcome to the Linux shell! Here's what we will cover in this lesson:

***🃏 Wildcards***
- `*` `?` `[abc]` `[0-9]` `{a..z}` for matching files
- Using wildcards in commands like `ls`, `cp`, and `rm`
- Escaping wildcards with `\` or using quotes
- Examples of wildcard usage in file operations
- Combining wildcards with other commands (e.g., `find`, `grep`)
- Practical examples of using wildcards in scripts
- Tips for avoiding common pitfalls with wildcards
- Understanding how wildcards interact with shell globbing

# 🃏 Wildcards in the Shell
Wildcards are special characters used to match filenames or directories in flexible ways.

> 📌 Why use wildcards?

They let you reference **many files at once** without typing each name individually — essential for automation and scripting.

---

# ✴️ The `*` Wildcard
The `*` matches **zero or more characters** in filenames.

> 📌 Examples

```bash
ls *.cfg
````

* Lists all `.cfg` files in the current directory.

```bash
ls /data/aircraft/configurations/mq-1c/*.cfg
```

* Lists all `.cfg` files in the `mq-1c` directory.

---

# ❓ The `?` Wildcard

The `?` matches **exactly one character** in a filename.

> 📌 Example

```bash
ls flight_??.log
```

* Matches `flight_01.log`, `flight_99.log`, but **not** `flight_100.log`.

---

# 🧵 Character Ranges `[ ]`

Square brackets match **one character** from a specified range or set.

> 📌 Examples

```bash
ls n[1-3]*.cfg
```

* Matches files starting with `n1`, `n2`, or `n3`.

```bash
ls [a-z]*.txt
```

* Matches files that begin with any lowercase letter.

---

# 🔄 Combining Wildcards

You can combine `*`, `?`, and `[ ]` to form complex patterns.

> 📌 Example

```bash
ls /data/aircraft/configurations/*/n1??*.cfg
```

* Matches config files starting with `n1` in **any subdirectory**.

---

# 🧪 Practice Prompts

Try solving these using wildcards:

1. List all `.cfg` files in the `mq-1c` directory.
2. List all `index.cfg` files in any subdirectory of `/data/aircraft/configurations`.
3. Copy all `.cfg` files in `mq-20` to a `backup/` directory.
4. Count how many `.cfg` files begin with `n1` in all subdirectories.
5. Use `grep` to search for the word "Patrol" in all `.cfg` files under `mq-9`.
