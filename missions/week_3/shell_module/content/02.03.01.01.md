# ðŸ“‚ Absolute vs. Relative Paths
Understanding file paths is essential when navigating the Linux filesystem.

> ðŸ”„ Relative Paths
- Based on your **current** working directory
- Do **not** start with `/`
- Shorter, more flexible
- Examples:
  - `documents/report.txt`
  - `../shared/data.csv` (one level up)
Use `.` for the current directory and `..` to go up one level.
