# ðŸ“‚ Absolute vs. Relative Paths
Understanding file paths is essential when navigating the Linux filesystem.
> ðŸ“Œ What is a Path?

A **path** tells the shell where a file or directory is located.
---
> ðŸ”’ Absolute Paths
- Start from the root (`/`)
- Always begin with `/`
- Work no matter where you are
- Example, you could be in any directory and still access the file:
  - ***cat `/home/user/documents/report.txt`***
