# 🐚 Introduction to Shell Basics (🔁 Redirecting Input Output)

# 🔄 Appending Output with `>>`

The `>>` symbol sends stdout to a file, but **appends** to the end instead of overwriting.

> 📌 Example

```bash
echo "# Mission complete" >> flight.log
```

* This adds a line to `flight.log` without deleting previous content.
