# 🛠️ Running Background Jobs in the Shell
Sometimes, you want to run a command **without waiting** for it to finish.
---
>  🎯 What is a Background Job?
A background job runs **while you continue using the terminal**.
---
>  🚀 Running a Job in the Background
Add `&` at the end of a command:
```bash
sleep 30 &
````
You’ll see something like:
```
[1] 12345
```
* `[1]` is the **job number**
* `12345` is the **process ID (PID)**
---
>  🧪 Managing Jobs
* `jobs` — list background jobs
* `fg` — bring job to foreground
* `bg` — resume a stopped job in background
* `kill %1` — stop job number 1
---
Use background jobs to multitask efficiently in the shell!
