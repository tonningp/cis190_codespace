# 🔁 Input & Output Redirection in the Shell
Linux commands usually read from **standard input (stdin)** and write to **standard output (stdout)**.

>  📤 Output Redirection

- Use `>` to redirect output to a file (overwrites):
  ```bash
  ls > files.txt
````
* Use `>>` to **append** to a file:

  ```bash
  echo "Hello" >> log.txt
  ```

>  📥 Input Redirection

* Use `<` to read input from a file:

  ```bash
  sort < names.txt
  ```
---
>  🛑 Dangers
* `>` **overwrites** files!
* Use `set -o noclobber` to prevent accidental overwrite.

>  📦 Combine Them
```bash
sort < unsorted.txt > sorted.txt
```
Redirecting helps automate tasks and manage data efficiently.
