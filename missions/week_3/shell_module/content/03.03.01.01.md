# 🐚 Introduction to Shell Basics (🔁 Redirecting Input Output)

# 🔁 Redirecting Output with `>`
The `>` symbol sends **stdout (standard output)** to a file, **overwriting** it.

> 📌 Example

```bash
cat /data/aircraft/configurations/mq-1c/n101gh.cfg > summary.txt
````

* This writes the contents of the config file to `summary.txt`, replacing any existing content.
