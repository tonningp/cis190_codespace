# 🔁 Input & Output Redirection in the Shell
Linux commands usually read from **standard input (stdin)** and write to **standard output (stdout)**.

>  📤 Output Redirection

- Use `>` to redirect output to a file (overwrites):
```bash
  ls > files.txt
```
* Use `>>` to **append** to a file:

```bash
echo "Hello" >> log.txt
```
