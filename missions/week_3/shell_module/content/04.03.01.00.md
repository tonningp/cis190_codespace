# 🔗 Command Pipelining in the Shell
**Pipelining** lets you connect commands—sending the **output** of one into the **input** of another.
---
>  🧱 Basic Syntax
```bash
command1 | command2
````
Example:
```bash
ls | sort
```
* `ls` lists files
* `sort` arranges them alphabetically
---
>  🔍 Filter Example
```bash
who | grep alice
```
* `who` shows logged-in users
* `grep alice` filters for "alice"
---
>  📜 View Long Output
```bash
ls -l /etc | less
```
Use `less` to scroll through output one screen at a time.
---
Pipelines eliminate the need for temporary files and make shell usage efficient!
