# ðŸ“‚ Absolute and Relative Paths

## Parent Directory
Use `.` for the current directory and `..` for the parent to go up one level.

Examples:
- `documents/report.txt`
- `cd ../shared`
- `../shared/data.csv` (file one level up)

---
> âœ… Quick Tip
Use `ls` and `cd` with either path type:
- `cd /etc`
- `cd ../logs`
- You can change to the previous directory you were in with `cd -`.
