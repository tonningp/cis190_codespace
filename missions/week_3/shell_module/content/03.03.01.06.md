# 🐚 Introduction to Shell Basics (🔁 Redirecting Input Output)

## 🧪 Practice Prompts

> Try to answer these using redirection and pipes:

`Note: Use the terminal to practice these commands. They are not required to be
run in this environment.  They are also not required for the course.`

1. Redirect the contents of `n101gh.cfg` into a file called `summary.txt`
2. Append the line `# Mission complete` to `flight.log`
3. Count lines in `n234ij.cfg` using `<` instead of as a command argument
4. Use a here-document to create `instructions.txt` with multiple lines
5. Pipe the output of `cat` into `grep` to find the `payload` line in a config file
