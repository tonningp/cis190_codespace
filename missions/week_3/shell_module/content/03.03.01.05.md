# 🐚 Introduction to Shell Basics (🔁 Redirecting Input Output)

## 🔧 Connecting Commands with `|`

The pipe `|` sends the **stdout of one command** into the **stdin of another**.

> 📌 Example

```bash
cat /data/aircraft/configurations/mojave/n123ab.cfg | grep payload
```

* This prints only the line that includes `payload` from the config file.
