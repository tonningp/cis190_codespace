# 🐚 Introduction to Shell Basics (🔁 Redirecting Input Output)

# 📥 Redirecting Input with `<`

The `<` symbol feeds a file as **stdin (standard input)** to a command.

> 📌 Example

```bash
wc -l < /data/aircraft/configurations/mq-20/n234ij.cfg
```

* This counts lines in the config file using redirected input.
