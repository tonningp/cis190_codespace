# ðŸ“‚ Absolute vs. Relative Paths
Understanding file paths is essential when navigating the Linux filesystem.
> ðŸ“Œ What is a Path?

A **path** tells the shell where a file or directory is located.
---
> ðŸ”’ Absolute Paths
- Start from the root (`/`)
- Always begin with `/`
- Work no matter where you are
- Example:
  - `/home/user/documents/report.txt`
Use `pwd` to see your current absolute path.
---
> ðŸ”„ Relative Paths
- Based on your **current** working directory
- Do **not** start with `/`
- Shorter, more flexible
- Examples:
  - `documents/report.txt`
  - `../shared/data.csv` (one level up)
Use `.` for the current directory and `..` to go up one level.
---
> âœ… Quick Tip
Use `ls` and `cd` with either path type:
- `cd /etc`
- `cd ../logs`
