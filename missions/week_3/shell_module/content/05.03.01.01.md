# üÉè Wildcards in the Shell
Wildcards let you match multiple files without typing each name.
---
>  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Asterisk: `*`
Matches **zero or more characters**.
```bash
ls *.txt
````
‚Üí Lists all files ending in `.txt`
---
>  ‚ùì Question Mark: `?`
Matches **exactly one character**.
```bash
ls file?.txt
```
‚Üí Matches `file1.txt`, `fileA.txt`, etc.
---
>  üî§ Brackets: `[ ]`
Match **one character from a set or range**.
```bash
ls report[1-3].txt
```
‚Üí Matches `report1.txt`, `report2.txt`, `report3.txt`
---
>  ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips
* Wildcards are expanded **by the shell**, not the command.
* Use `echo` to test expansion:
  ```bash
  echo *.log
  ```
Wildcards save time and reduce typing when working with groups of files!
