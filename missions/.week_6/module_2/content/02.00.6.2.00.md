# Introduction to the `sed` Editor

The `sed` (stream editor) utility transforms input streams from files or standard input. It operates as a batch editor, often used as a filter or in pipelines. 
Unlike interactive editors, `sed` is more efficient due to its single-pass input processing.
Most Linux distributions provide GNU `sed`, while BSD (like OpenBSD or FreeBSD) supplies BSD `sed`.
