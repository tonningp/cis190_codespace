# Expressions in Shell Scripts

#### Arithmetic and Logical Expressions

- Use `let` or `((expression))` for arithmetic evaluations
- Conditional expressions use `[[ expression ]]` for logical evaluations

```bash
let "VALUE=VALUE * 10 + NEW"
if [[ $age -gt 18 ]]; then
  echo "Adult"
fi
```

Expressions perform calculations and evaluate conditions, driving script logic.
