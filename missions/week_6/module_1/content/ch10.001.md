# Introduction to Shell Programming

Shell scripts automate tasks in Linux environments. They offer:

- Decision-making and looping control structures
- Modularization through functions
- Access to system utilities and user programs

Shell scripts use the Bourne Again Shell (bash) language, providing structural features similar to high-level programming languages like C and Perl.
