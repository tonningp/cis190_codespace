# Key Control Structures in Bash

#### Decision-Making

- **if...then, if...then...else**: Execute commands conditionally
- **case**: Multiway branching based on pattern matching

#### Looping

- **for...in, while, until**: Repeat tasks iteratively

These structures enable automation of repetitive tasks, making scripts more efficient and dynamic.
