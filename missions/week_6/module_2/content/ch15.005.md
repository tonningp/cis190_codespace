A `sed` program consists of:
```bash
[address[,address]] instruction [argument-list]
```
- **Addresses**: Optional; selects lines for processing.
- **Instruction**: Modifies text based on selected lines.

#### Processing Steps:
1. Read a line of input.
2. Apply instructions if addresses match.
3. Repeat until all instructions are applied.
4. Continue to next line or finish if no input remains.
