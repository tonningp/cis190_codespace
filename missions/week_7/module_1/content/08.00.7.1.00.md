# Restoring Files with `rsync`

To restore the most recent copy of a file:
1. List all backups to find the most recent version.
2. Use `cp -a` to copy the file while preserving its attributes.

```bash
cp -a bu.0/0514 ~max/memos
```

> **Note:** Ensure the restored file has the correct time and date attributes by using the `-a` option.
