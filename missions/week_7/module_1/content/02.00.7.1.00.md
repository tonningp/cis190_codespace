# The `rsync` Secure Copy Utility

The `rsync` (remote synchronization) utility is used to copy files and directory hierarchies locally or over a network. It uses OpenSSH by default, providing secure file transfers with authentication mechanisms similar to OpenSSH. You can also use the `rsyncd` daemon as a transfer agent.

#### Syntax
```bash
rsync [options] [[user@]from-host:]source-file [[user@]to-host:][destination-file]
```

This command copies files and directories on the local system or between local and remote systems.
