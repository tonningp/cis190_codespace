# Tunneling and Port Forwarding

#### Forwarding Ports

- **Local Forwarding**: Use `-L` to forward a local port to a remote system.
- **Remote Forwarding**: Use `-R` for the reverse operation.

Example of tunneling POP through `ssh`:

```bash
ssh -N -L 1550:pophost:110 pophost
```

#### Firewalls

- Port forwarding can bypass firewalls by connecting through an intermediary system.

> **Note**: Compression (`-C`) can enhance performance over low-bandwidth connections.
