# Configuring OpenSSH Clients

#### Recommended Settings

- **X11 Forwarding**: Adjust `ForwardX11Trusted` in the configuration for secure or usable settings.
- **Server Authentication/Known Hosts**: Use `~/.ssh/known_hosts` for managing recognized hosts.

#### First-time Authentication

When connecting for the first time:

```bash
ssh remote_host
```

You'll be prompted with:

```
The authenticity of host 'remote_host' can't be established.
```

Verify the host and respond with `yes`.
