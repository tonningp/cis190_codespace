# Introduction to OpenSSH

OpenSSH is a suite of secure network connectivity tools that encrypt traffic, including passwords, to prevent eavesdropping and connection hijacking. This section covers the following OpenSSH tools:

- `scp`: Copies files to/from a remote system
- `sftp`: Secure alternative to FTP
- `ssh`: Logs in or executes commands on a remote system
- `sshd`: OpenSSH daemon
- `ssh-add`: Adds a passphrase for a private key
- `ssh-agent`: Holds private keys
- `ssh-copy-id`: Appends public key to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`
- `ssh-keygen`: Manages RSA/DSA host/user keys
